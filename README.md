My personal web page, couple different projects under this. 

## Australia Net 2PP Chart

Started out as a chart to show net 2PP in polls and their changes over times
Currently a work in progress with a lot of feature creep.

[Basic Mode:](https://schmilly.github.io/2PP%20Net/2PP.html)
Which collects changes in 2PP over years:
This collects all polling data from 2007 election to modern day

[Advance Mode:](https://schmilly.github.io/2PP%20Net/Advance_Mode.html)
This only has 2PP from 2022 election to today
However it does allow for setting custom 2PP Flows and preferences, which can enable further analysis of trends and current 2PP Flows

##### Known Bugs:
- [ ] Can't reset Zoom of 2PP Chart
- [ ] Unable to go back to non-custom 2PP mode once checkbox has been checked; Unchecking checkbox simply freezes 2PP values.

##### Planned features and further support:
- [ ] Ability to filter out pollsters in Advance Mode - i.e. show only Roy Morgan or News Polls polls
- [ ] Add all 2PP periods seen in Basic Mode to Advance mode
- [ ] Add 2PP periods/government terms from before 2007 
- [ ] Add Parliamentary map and seats based calculation, with changes in primary vote reflected in Parliament


## Tasmania Coalition Calculator Project

Election ended, no longer working on, potential to port to Federal election but unlikely. Will use some of this code to improve 2PP and help with Parliament calculations.
