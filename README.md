My personal web page, couple different projects under this. 

## Australia Net 2PP Chart

Pretty happy with outcome of this. Still requires manual updating which I don't like, but would probably require automatic commits, or a major refactoring to fix issue (pull from Wikipedia directly?)

Update every couple weeks or when I can remember to do so.

## Tasmania Coalition Calculator Project

Election ended, no longer working on, potential to port to Federal election but unlikely.

please report any issues or suggestions to schmilly@proton.me
