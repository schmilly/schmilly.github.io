</font><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">themselves </font><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">become
a monoculture. They aren’t as resilient as a forest of diversity,
and potentially miss </font><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">out

potential for experimentation. It risks </font><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">the
</font><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">forest</font><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">
itself withering, </font><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">and if
a single disease comes in it wipes out the entire monocultural
forest.</font><font face="Liberation Serif, serif"> A singular
dictation of a forest, </font><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">with
singular </font><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">species and
</font><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">planted locations </font><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">does
not and can never work in the long term. </font><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">It
works initially, but cannot be sustained forever.</font><font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote1anc" href="#sdfootnote1sym"><sup>1</sup></a></font></p>
<p><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">While this metaphor is
dubiously related, I believe it’s what RAHU is today. A monoculture
forest can grown, and the saplings planted in Victoria have grown and
themselves has spread its saplings from one side of so-called
Australia to the other. From Boorloo to Naarm to land of the
Kombumerri people, Renters are using the RAHU to organise and plant
their own metaphorical tree. As we have grown,  we can foresee the
structure of RAHU needs to evolve to match our ambition. The current
constitution was written for a smaller, more centralised union. It
worked well to get where we are today, but as branches keep popping
up across the country, the need for branch autonomy is becoming
greater and greater. Its time to allow for a diversification of our
forest.</font></p>
<p><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">This is why I proposed these
amendments under “Proposal for a more Federated RAHU”. The
proposed amendments are a crucial update to empower our branches,
protect our democratic spirit, and prepare us for the future. This
isn't about creating conflict between the Governing Committee and
branches. It’s about building a clear, democratic, and resilient
framework for a truly national union.</font></p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">The core of a strong union,
any strong and competent and militant union, is that power of its
local members to act on the issues that matter most to them. This
proposal entrenches that principle in our constitution.</font></p>
<p><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">Branches will have the clear
power to create their own by-laws tailored to local campaigns,
landlord tactics, state-based legislation and the make up of members.
Branches shouldn’t need to fight for the autonomy to act, and ask
for exemptions. This proposal grants them this autonomy, while still
holding them to the spirit of the RAHU constitution. This is real,
de-jure autonomy, not just de-facto autonomy as allowed for by the
secretary or leadership of the day.</font></p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">A healthy democracy needs
checks and balances. This proposal clearly defines the limits of the
Governing Committee's power, preventing potential future overreach
and cutting down on bureaucracy. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">The old rule 12(4) was a
broad &quot;override&quot; clause. The new one specifies </font><em><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">when</font></em><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">
and </font><em><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">on what matters</font></em><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">
the </font><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">Governing Committee</font><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">’s
interpretation prevails (e.g., constitutional interpretation,
expulsions). This prevents a scenario where a future </font><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">Governing
Committee</font><font face="Liberation Serif, serif"> could casually
override a branch's democratic decisions on a whim. </font><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">But
still allows for the Governing Committee to step in when required. </font>
</p>
<p><strong><font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><span style="font-weight: normal">W</span></font></strong><strong><font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><span style="font-weight: normal">e
need </span></font></strong><strong><font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><span style="font-weight: normal">l</span></font></strong><strong><font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><span style="font-weight: normal">ess

</font></strong><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">The current
process for branches to do anything that might contradict a GC by-law
is cumbersome. </font><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">An
</font><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">exemption process just
feels like a lot of effort and more bureaucracy to wade through. This
change replaces a permission-based system with a principles-based
one, freeing up organisers' time for what matters: building power for
renters.</font></p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">We are building a union not
just for today, but for the next decade and beyond. This structure is
designed for growth and stability. Under the new model, if the
Governing Committee passes a well-intentioned but poorly worded
General Bylaw, it doesn't automatically cripple every branch.
Branches can maintain their own effective rules while the issue is
fixed at a national level. This means less time has to be spent by
every branch checking and double-checking every single Governing
Committee decision for unintended consequences.</font></p>
<p><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">It is also essential for
Growth and affiliation. If we want SEQUR to ever affiliate, I am of
the opinion that they will not find the current status quo of
Governing Committee primacy acceptable. To bring all renters into one
big union, we must be a union that respects the autonomy of its
constituent parts. This federated model is the standard for
successful, large-scale democratic organisations. We cannot have such
a centralised union otherwise. </font>
</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">A person at an event talks to
RAHU member, and says their keen to join, but (perhaps fairly or
unfairly) cites drama or an incident in another state or branch.
Perhaps the member recruiting knows about this and can present a
spirited defence, perhaps they don’t and will have to look into it
later, but it allows this recruiter to say “well I am not sure
about that, but branches in RAHU have the autonomy to be different
from each other.” While technically true at the moment, it is only
in de-factor terms. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">This constitution formalises
this ability to defer and to present ourselves independent of the
mistakes that other branches may or may not have made, and also
allows us to bring in members to <i>educate </i><span style="font-style: normal">them
about these mistakes if they are unfairly construing a RAHU branch
incorrectly. Half the battle is getting them through the door.</span></font></p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">It also allows for greater
experimentation and encourages members to write the bylaws for <i>their</i>
branch and <i>their</i> situation. The ownus for responsibility of
ensuring compatibility of bylaws should fall upon those in the
highest positions of the unions, not the enthusiastic member who
wishes to make the union for them and <i>their </i>comrades.</font></p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">It is also fundamentally a
question of ideology. How can we really call ourselves a “Syndicalist
Union” - as in our current constitution – when we have such
centralisation. Such centralisation is the anti-thesis of how all
syndicalist unions have operated through out history.</font></p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">There are objections from
some - very fair objection I must add – with some worrying about
this proposal taking away the ability for Governing Committee to
override branches means a dis-empowering of those important equity
committees. Disability Committee members specifically has raised
issues with the proposal, and fairly enough, the gains and
improvements upon the disabled members of RAHU has allowed for the
expansion of participation in such meetings. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">However, I will remind them
that the Governing Committee is still able to suspend branches under
Section 12(3) <i>“The Governing Committee may temporarily limit any
power of a branch for 30 days.”</i> <span style="font-style: normal">Further
if the Governing Committee does see a branch consistently ignore and
not follow the bylaws and wishes of these committees, </span><span style="font-style: normal">under
Section 18(1) the Governing Committee can still vote to dissolve such
a branch. </span></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Let’s
also not forget, that as a whole, the Governing Committee is a body
of all branches and must set by-laws for all branches. There is
perhaps branches that would </span><i>want </i><span style="font-style: normal">to
adopt a more progressive version of certain bylaws, but would be
unable to due to how the committee is setup. A literal example of
this is a recent by laws strict down in the WA branch, which actually
created stricter version of the clean air policy, but was not able to
be followed due to how the current constitution is setup. </span></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><span style="font-style: normal">Additionally,
all branches are still beholden to the RAHU constitution itself. The
common line voted for by the common membership. </span><span style="font-style: normal">If
a rule is important enough, it can be set in stone at an Annual
General Meeting.</span><span style="font-style: normal"> </span></font>
</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">Fundamentally we have a
choice. We address this issue now, and take early steps to ensure
branches can make decisions and fight for themselves, or we can delay
and wait and risk creating a divison of renters. This proposal
strikes a careful and powerful balance. It gives branches the freedom
to be agile and militant in their local context, while maintaining
national unity through a common constitution, ideology and clear,
powers for the Governing Committee. It builds a RAHU that is ready to
grow, ready to fight, and truly owned by its members in every state.</font></p>
<p><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">Renters in Australia cannot
afford for a new forest to split off. If we want to get every renter
in a common singular, national union, we must adopt these changes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">So, let’s plant some
saplings shall we?</font></p>
