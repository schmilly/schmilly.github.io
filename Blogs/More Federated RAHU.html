<p>In any forest, when it grows, it must spread itself with diversity
of independent species. Each tree must individually adapt itself to
the unique environment terrain and space it occupies. Roots, saplings
and plants must manoeuvre, find, fight and co-operate in any way they
can to get the nutrition and water that they need to grow. If a
forest were to have identical species of trees then it becomes a
monoculture. Mono cultures are brittle, they’re not resilient as a
forest of the diverse, and potentially miss out on gaining nutrition,
energy and  the potential for experimentation. It risks the forest
itself withering, and if a single disease comes in it wipes out the
entire monocultural forest. A singular dictation of a forest, with
singular species and planted locations does not and can never work in
the long term. It works initially, but cannot be sustained forever.
They can, however, can be setup quicker then a truly natural forest.
<a class="sdfootnoteanc" name="sdfootnote1anc" href="#sdfootnote1sym"><sup>1</sup></a>
</p>
<p>While this metaphor is dubiously related, I believe it’s what
RAHU is today. A monoculture forest can grown - quite rapidly even - and the saplings
planted in Victoria have grown and themselves has spread their own saplings
from one side of so-called Australia to the other. From Boorloo to
Naarm to land of the Kombumerri people, Renters are using the RAHU to
organise and plant their own metaphorical tree. As we have grown, we
can foresee the structure of RAHU needs to evolve to match our
ambition. The <a href="https://rahu.org.au/constitution">current constitution</a> was written for a smaller, more
centralised union. It worked well to get where we are today, but as
branches keep popping up across the country, the need for branch
autonomy is becoming greater and greater. Its time to allow for a
diversification of our forest.</p>
<p>This is why I proposed these amendments under “Proposal for a
more Federated RAHU”. The proposed amendments are a crucial update
to empower our branches, protect our democratic spirit, and prepare
us for the future. This isn't about creating conflict between the
Governing Committee and branches. It’s about building a clear,
democratic, and resilient framework for a truly national union.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>The core of a strong union, any strong and competent and militant
union, is that power of its local members to act on the issues that
matter most to them. This proposal entrenches that principle in our
constitution.</p>
<p>Branches will have the clear power to create their own by-laws
tailored to local campaigns, landlord tactics, state-based
legislation and the make up of members. Branches shouldn’t need to
fight for the autonomy to act, and ask for exemptions. This proposal
grants them this autonomy, while still holding them to the spirit of
the RAHU constitution. This is real, de-jure autonomy, not just
de-facto autonomy as allowed for by the secretary or leadership of
the day.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>A healthy democracy needs checks and balances. This proposal
clearly defines the limits of the Governing Committee's power,
preventing potential future overreach and cutting down on
bureaucracy. 
</p>
<p>The old rule 12(4) was a broad &quot;override&quot; clause. The
new one specifies <em>on what matters</em> the Governing Committee’s
interpretation prevails (e.g., constitutional interpretation,
expulsions). This prevents a scenario where a future Governing
Committee could casually override a branch's democratic decisions on
a whim. But still allows for the Governing Committee to step in when
required. 
</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: normal">We need less bureaucracy
and more organising.</span></strong><strong> </strong>The current
process for branches to do anything that might contradict a GC by-law
is cumbersome. An exemption process just feels like a lot of effort
and more bureaucracy to wade through. This change replaces a
permission-based system with a principles-based one, freeing up
organisers' time for what matters: building power for renters.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>We are building a union not just for today, but for the next
decade and beyond. This structure is designed for growth and
stability. Under the new model, if the Governing Committee passes a
well-intentioned but poorly worded General Bylaw, it doesn't
automatically cripple every branch. Branches can maintain their own
effective rules while the issue is fixed at a national level. This
means less time has to be spent by every branch checking and
double-checking every single Governing Committee decision for
unintended consequences.</p>
<p>It is also essential for Growth and affiliation. If we want SEQUR
to ever affiliate, I am of the opinion that they will not find the
current status quo of Governing Committee primacy acceptable. To
bring all renters into one big union, we must be a union that
respects the autonomy of its constituent parts. This federated model
is the standard for successful, large-scale democratic organisations.
We cannot have such a centralised union otherwise. 
</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>A person at an event talks to RAHU member. The person they talk to
says their keen to join, but (perhaps fairly or unfairly) cites
drama, overhead incident or even a minor rumour that has disused them
from joining in the past. Perhaps the member recruiting knows about
this and can present a spirited defence, perhaps they don’t and
will have to look into it later, but it allows this recruiter to say
“well I am not sure about that, but branches in RAHU have the
autonomy to be different from each other.” While technically true
at the moment, it is only in de-factor terms. 
</p>
<p>This constitution formalises this ability to defer and to present
ourselves independent of the mistakes that other branches may or may
not have made, and also allows us to bring in members to <i>educate
</i><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">them
about these mistakes if they are unfairly construing a RAHU branch
incorrectly. Half the battle is getting them through the door.</span></span></p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>It also allows for greater experimentation and encourages members
to write the bylaws for <i>their</i> branch and <i>their</i>
situation. The ownus for responsibility of ensuring compatibility of
bylaws should fall upon those in the highest positions of the unions,
not the enthusiastic member who wishes to make the union for them and
<i>their </i>comrades.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>It is also fundamentally a question of ideology. How can we really
call ourselves a “Syndicalist Union” - as in our current
constitution – when we have such centralisation. Such
centralisation is the anti-thesis of how all syndicalist unions have
operated through out history.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>There are objections from some - very fair objection I must add –
with some worrying about this proposal taking away the ability for
Governing Committee to override branches means a dis-empowering of
those important equity committees. Disability Committee members
specifically has raised issues with the proposal, and fairly enough,
the gains and improvements upon the disabled members of RAHU has
allowed for the expansion of participation in such meetings. 
</p>
<p>However, I will remind them that the Governing Committee is still
able to suspend branches under Section 12(3) “<i>The Governing
Committee may temporarily limit any power of a branch for 30 days.”</i>
<span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">Further
if the Governing Committee does see a branch consistently ignore and
not follow the bylaws and wishes of these committees, under Section
18(1) the Governing Committee can still vote to dissolve such a
branch. </span></span>
</p>
<p>Let’s also not forget, that as a whole, the Governing Committee
is a body of all branches and must set by-laws for all branches.
There is perhaps branches that would <i>want </i><span style="font-variant: normal"><span style="font-style: normal">to
adopt a more progressive version of certain bylaws, but would be
unable to due to how the committee is setup. A literal example of
this is a recent by laws strict down in the WA branch, which actually
created stricter version of the clean air policy, but was not able to
be followed due to how the current constitution is setup. </span></span>
</p>
<p>Additionally, all branches are still beholden to the RAHU
constitution itself. The common line voted for by the common
membership. If a rule is important enough, it can be set in stone at
an Annual General Meeting.<span style="font-variant: normal"> </span>
</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>Fundamentally we have a choice. We address this issue now, and
take early steps to ensure branches can make decisions and fight for
themselves, or we can delay and wait and risk creating a divison of
renters. This proposal strikes a careful and powerful balance. It
gives branches the freedom to be agile and militant in their local
context, while maintaining national unity through a common
constitution, ideology and clear, powers for the Governing Committee.
It builds a RAHU that is ready to grow, ready to fight, and truly
owned by its members in every state.</p>
<p>Renters in Australia cannot afford for a new forest to split off.
If we want to get every renter in a common singular, national union,
we must adopt these changes.</p>
<p>So, let’s plant some saplings shall we?</p>
